# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
A Colorado board of Elections employee gave me the task of completing an election audit for the recent local congressional election between Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. Once the task was finished, they requested if I could go more into detail and include:
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count 
- The county with the highest turnout

Of course, I said yes! I went back to work and included all of that information. Below is my work.

## Resources 
- Our main data source was an excel file: election_results.csv
- We used Python 3.7.6 and Visual Studio Code

## Election Audit Results
- How many votes were casted in this congressional election?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
1. There were 369,711 total votes casted in the election
2. The main candidates were 
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
3. The final voting results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the votes with a total count of 85,213 votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes with a total count of 272,892 votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes with a total count of 11,606 votes
4. The winning candidate was Diana Degette, as she received over 73% of the votes

## Challenge Overview 
For this challenge we did the most coding we have done to date. We used the Excel CSV file and linked it to the Visual Studio Code application. There, we started by assigning variables and initializin the voter count. Once the variables were created, we used various formulas to have the excel do the work for us. We set conditionals to pull data in a specific manner and once everything was finalized, we printed the candidates results to the terminal. 

## Challenge Summary
This challenge was very hard. I ran into multiple issues were my file somehow disconnected from the VS Code and I had to mess with the applications and my file structure on my computer to get it to stay connected. I am not sure how that happened but finally I got it to work. Overall, the coding portion wasn't too hard, just very tedious. It took a lot of patience but once everything ran smoothly, it was rewarding. 

## Election-Audit Summary
#### In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
