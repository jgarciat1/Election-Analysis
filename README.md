# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado board of Elections employee gave me the task of completing an election audit for the recent local congressional election between Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane.

## Resources 
- Our main data source was an excel file: election_results.csv
- We used Python 3.7.6 and Visual Studio Code

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
1. There were 369,711 total votes casted in the election
2. The main candidates were 
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
3. The final voting results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the votes with a total count of 85,213 votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes with a total count of 272,892 votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes with a total count of 11,606 votes
4. The winning candidate was Diana Degette, as she received over 73% of the votes

## Challenge Overview 
For this challenge we did the most coding we have done to date. We used the Excel CSV file and linked it to the Visual Studio Code application. There, we started by assigning variables and initializin the voter count. Once the variables were created, we used various formulas to have the excel do the work for us. We set conditionals to pull data in a specific manner and once everything was finalized, we printed the candidates results to the terminal. 

## Challenge Summary
This challenge was very hard. I ran into multiple issues were my file somehow disconnected from the VS Code and I had to mess with the applications and my file structure on my computer to get it to stay connected. I am not sure how that happened but finally I got it to work. Overall, the coding portion wasn't too hard, just very tedious. It took a lot of patience but once everything ran smoothly, it was rewarding.
